Chromerivals is a private server of the famous online game ACEOnline, the developers have created an API with all the information of the game, leaving free the imagination of everyone who wants to play with it, I have made this app to create a useful tool for the server, making possible for users from their android mobile device see which events are active and search for game objects (how to get them and what are they for) and for learn about good practices and development on this platform.
